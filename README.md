# Chat App (Memory Utilization)

> A coding challenge to showcase my problem solving ability

#1 Problem definition
The main objective of this project is to develop a simple chat app that saves messages in memory

## How?

When a user first visits the chat, he/she is prompted to enter his username, which is further used to identify his messages. Each browser tab is a new chat user. I've utilized the Web Storage API by saving the messages in localStorage and the username in sessionStorage.

### Tools used

- React 18
- Material UI

#2. Installation and setup

1. First clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/mongare70/Chat-App.git`

2. cd into the **Chat-App** folder and run `npm install`.

3. Run `npm start` to start development server.

#3. Usage
The following screencast shows how to run the app. Check it out:

#4. Tests

After ensuring you're within the **Chat-App folder** run :

`npm test a`
